							<h2>&nbsp;the aircraft with the transmitter </h2>
							<p>For long the only way that people outside 
							the an aircraft could know where the 
							aircraft was, was either asking the pilot 
							(over radio), see it on radar, or well 
							spotting it in visual range.&nbsp; As the 
							airspace filled up, it became increasingly important for air 
							traffic 
							control (ATC) to know where all aircraft 
							were.&nbsp; In March 2003 ADS-B was 
							demonstrated for the first time to
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Air_Patrol" title=""> 
							Civil Air Patrol</a> (CAP) and soon the 
							technology started to appear on more and 
							more aircraft.</p>
							<p>So yes for the tile of this page we now 
							understand that the aircraft has a 
							transmitter (radio sending information) that 
							broadcast the ADS-B information, but where 
							does the aircraft get the information and 
							what information is transmitted.&nbsp; To 
							start, currently it is not mandated that 
							aircraft have ADS-B transmitter and when 
							they do have a ADS-B transmitter it is not 
							mandated what information they need to send.&nbsp; 
							This will however change in 2020 (for some 
							aircraft at least), when it will be mandated 
							to have ADS-B when flying in controlled 
							airspaces.</p>
							<p>As a minimum all ADS-B transitions will 
							contain the aircraft's&nbsp; ICAO address.&nbsp; 
							This address is unique and looks something 
							like this - 4AB358.&nbsp;&nbsp; With this 
							information one can actually find a lot of 
							information by doing a lookup in a public 
							database like
							<a href="http://www.airframes.org/">
							Airframes.org</a> (you have to register, but 
							it is free).</p>
							<p>Following the unique address the are a 
							few information categories that can also be 
							send by the ADS-b transmitter and these are:<br>
							<ol>
								<li>a)&nbsp; Aircraft identification</li>
								<li>b)&nbsp; Surface position</li>
								<li>c)&nbsp; Airborne position (w/ Baro Altitude)</li>
								<li>d)&nbsp; Airborne velocities</li>
								<li>e)&nbsp; Airborne position (w/ GNSS Height)</li>
								<li>f)&nbsp; Aircraft status</li>
								<li>g)&nbsp; Target state and status information</li>
								<li>h)&nbsp; Aircraft operation status</li>
							</ol></p>
							<p>As you can see there is quite a bit of 
							information the can be broadcast and all of 
							this information is supplied by the 
							aircraft's computers and mission systems.</p>
							<p>We now need to look at how does this information get from the aircraft to the systems that use this information.  Go on click
