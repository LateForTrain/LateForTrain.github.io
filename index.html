                    <p class="lead mb-5">This page was inspired by a Youtube video I saw (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXfFBEuCAr0">NetworkChuck</a>), which made me realize that even 
                        though I’m not an “expert” in anything, I do maybe have something that will help one other person. I have said it many times during performance 
                        evaluations that helping people is what charges my batteries.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">When I started my journey as an engineer the internet was still very exclusive for academia, but it completely fascinated me. The idea of 
                        interacting and sharing with people I might not even know, but have a common interest with was what really pulled me into it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">As an Industrial Engineer I then started down a path that took me through junior developer, system engineering, product management, 
                        project management and currently back in product management. And the industries that I’ve been involved with also varied, starting off 
                        with developing call centers, working with radars that track golf balls, trying to destroy incoming projectiles, and managing roadmaps 
                        for landscaping tools.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Now this page is most likely not going to teach you much about any of what I’ve mentioned. This page is for the stuff that I do once 
                        my day at the office is done. The stuff I’ve not ever made money with, but really fascinated me, and well yea maybe one day when I’m 
                        old could be a side hustle (I don’t believe I will ever get old, I will just have a very high age).
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">So what is it that keeps me busy? I don’t think there is any specific order in this list, but here we go:

                            I like creating 3D models and currently my application of choice is Blender. I have a few of my models showcased in blenderartist.org.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Radios and antennas are very fascinating and now with Software Defined Radios (SDR) a whole new world has been opened up.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I’ve always liked programming and started off on our Commodore 64 with basic. At university we had to do some Assembler 
                            (on Intel 8088 processor) and a Pascal like programming language called Modula 2. Most of my programming currently happens with Python. 
                            I'm hoping to link some repositories here later.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Electronics, and especially if I can interact with it through software, so yes my home is scattered with Raspberry Pi’s that are 
                            doing some sort of automation for me, be it uploading Aircraft ADSB information or hosting my Telegram Bot, and that is another story 
                            that we will most likely come to.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Ok for now let's stop there and get working on the notes I would like to share.</p>

                    <h2>Software Defined Radio (SDR)</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">The road to where I am using and playing with software defined radios started just after school 
                        and I wanted to build a radio that I saw in an old electronics book.  Luckily I never built the radio, since 
                        it was actually to be used on amature radio bands, and that would have got me in some trouble.  Four years 
                        later I understood a bit more about radios and actuall got my amature radio liscense.  Although I was never 
                        that active on the chat scene I did like playing with all sorts of digital communication.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Stepping forward, lets just say a few years, I mostly use the SDR decoding ADSB and building 
                        antennas.  One of the interesting things at the start I did not know was that Flightradar24, actually makes use 
                        of data feeds from private people in order to display the aircraft positions.  If you are interested in getting 
                        a Flightradar24 Business account by streaming data to them, head over to 
                        <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/add-coverage">Flighradar24 coverage</a> and look at the options of 
                        building your own decoder or ordering one from them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">In addition to ADSB, there are many other things that can be heard or looked at on the 
                        electromagnetic spectrum.  A good place to start is getting a <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/">
                        RTL-SDR dongle</a> and downloading the <a href="https://github.com/f4exb/sdrangel">SDRangel software</a> (be warned it is 
                        not the easiest tool but a very powerful one).

                    <h2>Coding</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">At the moment I mostly use Python as my go to programming language.  It is not the fastest 
                        or the most compact, but it has a large selection of modules that are created by all sorts of 
                        awesome humans.  It is also very easy to develop on my windows computer and then run on my Raspberry Pi(s).
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Before using Python I also went through a phase of using Java together with the Netbeans IDE.  
                        This was also an easy solution and even when interfacing with outside hardware worked real well both on 
                        Windows and Linux.  I would need to go and search for some of my Java projects, but back then I don't even 
                        know if Github was a thing yet (I believe I was actually running a local CVS (Concurrent Versions System) 
                        to store my source code).
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Here are some of the projects I have been working on:

                    <h2>Electronics</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">This section will contain electronic stuff.  
                    </p>

                    <h3>Tracking aircraft</h3>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">I have been very fortunate that my career choices had given me the opportunity to travel 
                        (and yes also very fortunate that I have a super supportive family), and over the last few years it has become 
                        a tradition that I send my flight details to my parents before each trip.  My parents use this information to 
                        follow my flights on flightradar24.com.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">For long I just assumed the aircraft data was something flightradar24 was receiving from air 
                        traffic control &ldquo;centres&rdquo;.  However in 2016 my interest in radios and radio communication introduced 
                        me to low cost software defined radios (SDRs) and what came with this new found knowledge that even I can 
                        contribute to supplying this magical aircraft position information.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">All aircrafts are equipped with a transmitter (radio) that sends out information about the 
                        aircraft ( ok, almost all aircrafts, there are some exceptions, but we won't get into that for now).  This 
                        technology is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast">
                        Automatic dependent surveillance&mdash;broadcast</a>, but most people just talk about ADS-B.  This information 
                        is not encrypted and therefore anyone can receive and decode it, and yes, then feed it to flightradar24, where 
                        they put all of the base-stations' information together (they also do some other fancy stuff, which we might 
                        be speaking about in the future).
